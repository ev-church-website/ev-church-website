TODO:
- About us section in netlify cms
    - links in the content
- google Calendar integrated onto the site as a list



== Bugs ==



== Content ==

- missing content from about us page (first section)
  - could we condense this?
- Missions and Outreach
- Classes
- Sermons (do we want to bring this over?)
    - yes but maybe we just store the top three and hide the rest


== Features ==

- Netlify CMS
  - setup content
  - fix google authentication (https://github.com/netlify/netlify-identity-widget/issues/118)
  - order events
  - look at refresh options
- work on the opening image
  - right now it's centered only because the maxWidth is set the the same value
  - maybe a faded border?
  - compress?
- it feels like something is missing at the top
